**Are you trying to perform an action for a prospect that is currently on your website?
The prospect went to such and such a page, so they must be interested in X product. Quick, mark that custom field in their profile.
WRONG : Use a form / form handler.

**Are you updated fields for a prospect currently on your site?
A form handler is a much better option. You can send it values and the prospects records will be authenticated
and the prospect's score can automatically be updated for the 'completion'
You can even use a <img> tag or hidden <iframe>

The advantage of using an iframe > form handler is that prospects will be scored / get the appropriate
visitor activity.

**Do you have a job server that will run API requests in the background?
If you run API requests in the background, your pages will load more slowly. If you don't have an API key stored locally (they expire every hour)
then you are running a minimum of 2 requests in the background. You should expect best case that each exteneral request takes ~1 second - because sometimes
the internet is slow.  
	So if you do:
		authentication,
		query,
		update,
	And your page is fast - page load speed is at 4 seconds already. Some people are already complaining.
